# Application Delivery

The best application is a running application. For our we worked on creating some amazing REST API so far but its no use to anyone if we don't have it accessible to others.

To have a Go REST API deployed we have a number of options. These are a few of them
1. Bare Metal
2. Virtual Machine
3. Docker Compose
4. Kubernetes
5. Managed PAAS (App Engine, Heroku etc)
